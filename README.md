## About

The idea is have something like notion but using files and folders instead of an usual database.

This is useful because you can link your notes/tasks to things that normally are not possible like PSD and MP4 files.

## Setup

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install // install root dependencies

npm install -ws // install packages dependencies

npm run dev // Run electron app
```

## FAQ

### What is the state of project?

Right now we are in a state of alpha, the app have all basic features implemented, but have with some bugs here and there, and also some parts need improvements!


### Why browsers, windows, macOS or antivirus complains about the app download/installation?

Both Windows and macOS apps need a payed certificate to avoid this warnings, but buy one is a very expensive investments that I can't do right now!

### Why app do not auto-update?

Same reason as before, to add self-update to the app it is required to have a payed certificate.
