# Vue

You can use vuejs in the setup block of your notes to define reactive variables

::alert{type="warning"}
This is still in a test feature and could not working very well for some cases
::

```js
:: setup
import { ref, watch } from "vue"

const count = ref(0)

::

Count: {{ count }}

:: button {
    variant="fill"
    color="primary"
    @click.stop="count++" 
}
    Increment {{ count }}
::
```
