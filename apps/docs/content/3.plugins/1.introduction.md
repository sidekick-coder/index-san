It is still in development but we already have the following features.

Check a sample plugin: [hello-plugin](https://github.com/sidekick-coder/index-san-hello-plugin)

## Adding a new plugin

To add a plugin you need to add create a folder in the ```.is/plugins``` folder

Inside the folder is required to have a ```index.js``` that exports the following:

```js[.is/plugins/hello/index.js]
export default {
    name: "Hello plugin", // display name
    // starting point to extend the app
    setup(){
        // extend the app
    }
}
```

This should make the plugin shows up in the plugins sidebar, where you can activate/deactivate it
