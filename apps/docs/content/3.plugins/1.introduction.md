Plugins are a way to extend the functionalities of the app

Currently it still a very new feature and not implemented fully but our initial goal is to have the following features.

::list
- Add a new import composable
- Add a new component
- Add a new entry resolver (system that shows a page component based on file extension)

## Add plugins

To add a plugin you need to add create a folder in the ```.is/plugins``` folder

Inside the folder is required to have a ```index.js``` that exports the following:

```js[.is/plugins/hello/index.js]
export default {
    name: "Hello plugin", // display name
    // starting point to extend the app
    setup(){
        console.log('Hello word')       
    }
}
```
