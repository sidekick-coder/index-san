# Introduction 

Hephaestus is the main editor of the app and is a hybrid editor of markdown & block editor.

## Data save as markdown

One of the goal of the editor is to have a very well synergy with normal markdown files, so all file contents are save as simple text files and converted to blocks in the editor startup.

This also meas that any other markdown file would be compatible

## Scripts & Code Evaluation

The editor also allows you to write javascript code in the setup and/or in some blocks of your notes.

This allow you to build notes in a very advanced way, for example:

::list
- Fetch stocks price from web, compare to you local csv files and show in your notes
- Add buttons that make GET & POST request for an external API
- Read multiples xml files and convert they into a consolidated csv file
- etc...
::


::alert{type="danger"}
But of course **with great power comes great responsibility**, your scripts would have a lot of power inside your workspace so you need to be carefully when running they and even more when using external scripts.
