# Getting Started

Index-san is a project that uses a very new technology of the broswer called [FileSystemApi](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API)

With this technology is possible to create and edit files in your computer using a web app, of course in safe & security way.

So our app does not require any installation our similiar action, you can just access the URL, give permission to the app access a folder in your computer and start using right away.

## Notes editor

To create a note just create a file with the **.hph** extension and the app will open the file using the Hephaestus editor, that is the main editor of the app
